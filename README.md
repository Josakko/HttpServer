### How do I use this server outside of my network?

- Using port forwarding, you can direct network traffic from a certain port on your firewall or router to a particular IP address or network device on your home network. This enables you to connect a local network device, such as a computer or server, to the internet.

- Depending on the router or firewall you're using, there may be different steps to enable port forwarding. To enable port forwarding on your router, follow these general instructions:

* 1. Connect to your router's web interface (by typing it's IP adress, found inside of the user manual, into a web browser). Running the command `ipconfig` (on Windows) `ifconfig` (on Linux and macOS) inside of a terminal will reveal the router's IP address.
Log into your router: You will need to enter a username and password. If you haven't changed the default login credentials, you can find them in the user manual (or by looking up it's manufacturer defaults online).
* 2. Find the port forwarding section: Once you're logged in, look for the "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Server" section. This section is usually located between the advanced settings or security section of the  web interface of the browser.
* 3. Add a new port forwarding rule: In the port forwarding section, add a new rule by specifying the protocol (TCP or UDP), the port you want to forward, and the local IP address of the device you want to forward traffic to.
* 4. Save your changes: Make sure to save your changes before you exit this interface.
* 5. Test your port forwarding: You can use online tools such as [canyouseeme.org](https://canyouseeme.org/) to check if your port is open or not.
